## Development Process

1. **Fork the repository** and create your branch from `main`
2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. **Make your changes** and ensure:
   - Code compiles without errors: `npm run build`
   - Tests pass: `npm test`
   - Linting passes: `npm run lint`
   - Code is formatted: `npm run format`
4. **Test your changes** in a real AWS environment if possible
5. **Write or update tests** as needed
6. **Update documentation** if you're changing functionality

### Local Development

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the project
npm run build

# Run tests
npm test

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Lint code
npm run lint

# Format code

### PR Title Format

Use conventional commit format for PR titles:

- `feat:` New feature
- `fix:` Bug fix
- `docs:` Documentation only changes
- `style:` Code style changes (formatting, etc)
- `refactor:` Code refactoring
- `test:` Adding or updating tests
- `chore:` Maintenance tasks

## Style Guide

### TypeScript Style Guide

We use ESLint and Prettier for code formatting. Run `npm run lint` and `npm run format` before committing.

Key conventions:
- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Prefer `const` over `let`
- Use meaningful variable names
- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs
- Keep functions small and focused
- Use async/await over promises when possible

### CDK Best Practices

- Use L2 constructs when available
- Create reusable constructs for common patterns
- Follow AWS CDK best practices
- Use meaningful construct IDs
- Implement proper tagging strategies
- Consider cost implications of resources

### Documentation Style

- Use clear, concise language
- Include code examples where helpful
- Keep README focused on getting started
- Put detailed guides in the `docs/` directory
- Update relevant documentation with your changes

## Commit Messages

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

```

```
